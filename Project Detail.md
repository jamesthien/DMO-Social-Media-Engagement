# DMO-Social-Media-Engagement
## 1. Overall Engagement Trends:
**Question**: What is the overall trend of social media engagement (likes, retweets) across all DMOs throughout the entire timeline? <br/>
Hint: Consider creating a line chart with time on the x-axis and engagement metrics on the y-axis.
## 2. Phase-wise Engagement Analysis:
**Question**: How does social media engagement vary across the pre-COVID, lockdown, and post-COVID phases?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by the '3-Phase' column and calculate average engagement metrics for each phase.
## 3. Impact of Tweet Characteristics on Engagement:
**Question**: Is there any correlation between word count (WC) and engagement (likes/retweets)?<br/>
Hint: Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between WC and engagement metrics.
## 4. Top Performing DMOs:
**Question**: Which DMOs have the highest average engagement in terms of likes and retweets?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by 'State' and calculate average engagement metrics.
## 5. Sentiment Analysis:
**Question**: How does the sentiment (positive/negative) of tweets change during different phases?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by '3-Phase' and calculate the percentage of positive and negative sentiments.
## 6. Impact of Hashtags and Mentions:
**Question**: Do tweets with more hashtags or mentions tend to have higher engagement?<br/>
Hint: Create scatter plots or bar charts to compare engagement metrics for different levels of hashtags and mentions.
## 7. Most Engaging Content Type:
**Question**: Which content type (e.g., text, image, video) receives the highest engagement on average?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by 'ContentType' and calculate average engagement metrics.
## 8. Day-wise Engagement Patterns:
**Question**: On which days of the week do DMOs typically receive the highest engagement?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by 'Day' and calculate average engagement metrics.
## 9. Impact of Followers on Engagement:
**Question**: Is there a correlation between the number of followers and engagement metrics?<br/>
Hint: Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between 'Followers' and engagement metrics.
## 10. Impact of Time of Day on Engagement:
**Question**: At what times of the day do DMOs experience the highest engagement?<br/>
Hint: Group the data by 'Time' and calculate average engagement metrics.
## Dashboard:
**Design a Dashboard**: Create a dashboard with four different visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including overall engagement trends, phase-wise analysis, top-performing DMOs, and sentiment analysis. Use appropriate chart types (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots) for effective visualization.
